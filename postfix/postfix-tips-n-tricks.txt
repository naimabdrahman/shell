=========================================================



To check the mail queue on your Linux mail server, use the following command:

$ mailq

This command shows the Postfix mail queue.

If your queue is filled up and the message takes several hours to be sent, then you should flush the mail queue.

$ postfix flush

Now, if you check your mail queue you should find it empty.
